# Analysis of Youtube Trending
Repository for final project of STAT 108: Linear Regression

In this repository, I wish to explore how certain characteristics of a youtube video such as its title, upload time affect the success of a video such as a video's viewcount. One question is whether certain clickbait strategies applied to titles of thumbnails of videos really affect the view count of a video. Additionally do these strategies affect how viewers perceive the video. For example, do videos with clickbait titles end up having a lower like to dislike ratio? I would suspect that specific ways of formatting titles is associated with an increased viewcount. 

The dataset was obtained through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rsrishav/youtube-trending-video-dataset?select=RU_youtube_trending_data.csv). The dataset includes all videos that have been trending starting from August of 2020 and includes data on all trending videos up to the present. I have decided only to include trending videos from the US and for the purpose of this project I have taken a random sample from the dataset.
